git clone https://github.com/Mr-Bossman/F1C100S-linux.git

cd F1C100S-linux

git submodule update --init

cd buildroot

make BR2_EXTERNAL=$PWD/../ F1C100S_defconfig

make

sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX



so i have been looking around and learning and aparently u can run buster on this chip its realy jenk but its works

so copy the sdcard.img to random directory and enter a termial there

sudo losetup -o 22020096 /dev/loop1 sdcard.img

sudo mount /dev/loop1 /mnt

sudo rm -rf /mnt/*

sudo debootstrap --foreign --arch armel buster /mnt http://deb.debian.org/debian/

sudo umount /mnt

sudo losetup -d /dev/loop1

sudo dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX

at this point if nothing changes in buster it should boot u will have very litle to work with but u can set it up better at this point its just a proof of consept
this was built on aug 24 2020 using debian buster idk to many version numbers to figure out 


notes this chip uses the armv5te micro architechure and most likely wont be suported in bullseye seeing that stretch doesnt is the last to suport armv4t u can make it output vga using a lot of resistors and either an opamp or some cmos or ttl buffers
